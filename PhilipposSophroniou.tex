\tagline{Amazing tag line that makes HR managers want to hire you immediately.\\The tag line is aligned with the bottom of the picture to the right, so if you have\\multiple lines it fills the space to your name from the bottom. You might want to\\introduce manual line breaks to make this look nicer then simply filling up the lines.}

    \section{Another section}
    
    This page uses the page style \texttt{highlightmain} which shows the highlight bar (gray) and the main part (white background) but omits the header. 
    The default page style is \texttt{headerhighlightmain} with all three elements.
    If you don't want header, nor highlight bar, use page style \texttt{\textbackslash pagestyle\{empty\}}.
    \medskip
    Neither main, nor highlight bar must be filled to make this template work.
    It is possible to use a page style with the highlight bar but leave it empty by setting an empty highlightbar \texttt{\textbackslash highlightbar\{\}}.
